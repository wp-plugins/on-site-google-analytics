This plugin provides WP admin's valuable data from Google Analytics on site without having to login to Google Analytics to get the information.

== Description ==

Google Analytics is a great tool, but requires some technical capabilities to understand it.  This plugin takes some very basic, 
although important, data from Google Analytics (using the Google Analytics export API) and displays the information
on the frontend of your blog/site to WP administrators.  The data provided by this plugin is:  

*   Pageviews  
*   Average Time On Page  
*   Bounce Rate
*   Exit Rate
*   Referring Sites
*   Keywords

This plugin is intended for non-technical users who are not viewing Google Analytics on daily basis or may not
know how to get this information from Google Analytics. Please consider donating a link to [SEO Strategy](http://www.seoatl.com/strategy) if you
